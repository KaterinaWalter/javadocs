> The AP Computer Science course offers comprehensive training in Java, a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language widely used by professional software engineers. Aligned with CollegeBoard‚Äôs ‚ÄúAP Computer Science A‚Äù standards, this college-level curriculum emphasizes proper programming methodology, algorithmic development, data structures, and class design. Supplementary topics of study include graphical interfaces, game design, and technology in modern culture. Students reinforce their understanding of these topics through analyzing problems, writing solutions in Java, and testing their own code. Assignments encompass a variety of coding tasks, ranging from short individual exercises to open-ended collaborative projects. In culmination of their learning, all students are required to take the Advanced Placement examination in May. This rigorous course is designed to equip students with a strong foundation in programming skills necessary to excel in the evolving field of computer science.
