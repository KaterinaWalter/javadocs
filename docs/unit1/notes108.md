Comments don‚Äôt run‚Äîthey _explain_. Your future self (and your teammates) will thank you.

## Types of comments

1) `//` single‚Äëline  
2) `/* ... */` multi‚Äëline block  
3) `/** ... */` Javadoc (for API‚Äëstyle docs)

Javadoc can be turned into HTML docs using `javadoc` (part of the JDK). It‚Äôs common to place Javadoc above **classes** and **methods** and to use tags like `@author`, `@since`, `@version`, `@param`, `@return`.

### Example

```java
/**
 * MyClass.java
 * @author Your Name
 * @since 2025-01-01
 * This class keeps track of the max score.
 */
public class MyClass {
    private int max = 10; // tracks the max score

    /** Prints the current max. */
    public void print() {
        System.out.println(max);
    }
}
````

> IDEs often render comments in italics/gray to make them easy to spot.

### Check Your Understanding ‚Äî comment types

Match each comment form:

* **single-line** ‚Üí `//`
* **multi-line** ‚Üí `/* ... */`
* **Javadoc** ‚Üí `/** ... */`

</div>

## Mini exercise ‚Äî add helpful comments

Create a `Multiply.java` that reads two ints and prints their product. Add:

* A **multi-line Javadoc** block above the class describing its purpose.
* **Single-line** comments above the input, the calculation, and the print.

Starter outline:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

/** 
 * Multiply: reads two integers and prints num1 x num2 = result.
 * Add your author/date here if you like.
 */
public class Multiply {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Read two numbers
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int num1 = scan.nextInt();
        int num2 = scan.nextInt();

        // Compute product
        int result = num1 * num2;

        // Print formatted result
        System.out.println(num1 + " x " + num2 + " = " + result);
        scan.close();
    }
}
```

## Preconditions and postconditions

* A **precondition** must be true before code runs (what your method *expects*).
* A **postcondition** is guaranteed after it runs (what your method *promises*).

APIs often document both. A method may not check its preconditions‚Äîit can assume callers satisfy them.

**Examples:**

* Division requires the **divisor ‚â† 0** (precondition).
* `Math.sqrt(x)` expects **x ‚â• 0**. If not, Java returns `NaN` (not a number); practically, think of the precondition as *non‚Äënegative input*.

### Try it

```java
public class SqRoot {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double num = 9;              // change from negative to non-negative
        System.out.println(Math.sqrt(num));
    }
}
```

* Precondition for `sqrt`: the argument is ‚â• 0.
* Postcondition: the return value squared (within floating‚Äëpoint error) is the original argument.

## Preconditions in a library method (Turtle)

A Turtle library‚Äôs `forward(int pixels)` typically has a precondition like:

* **0 ‚â§ pixels ‚â§ (world width/height limit)**

If you give a value outside the range, the method may clamp it so the turtle stays visible (a reasonable postcondition).

```java
/**
 * Moves the turtle forward.
 * @param pixels distance to move, in the current heading
 * Preconditions: 0 ‚â§ pixels ‚â§ world bounds
 * Postconditions: turtle moves forward, remains within world
 */
public void forward(int pixels) { ... }
```

<div class="task" markdown="block">

### Turtle preconditions (thought experiment)

* What happens if you try `forward(-50)`?
* What about a huge value (e.g., `forward(1_000_000)`)‚Äîdoes it clamp to the edge or ignore it?

(If you‚Äôre using the Swing Turtle from earlier lessons, test and observe; otherwise, reason about expected behavior using the documentation above.)

## Software validity, use‚Äëcase diagrams (context)

Not on the AP exam, but useful in practice:

* **Validity/testing**: Does the software do what it should? Break it on purpose (violating preconditions) to discover edge cases.
* **Use‚Äëcase diagrams**: Show how users interact with a system. Each use case can list preconditions and postconditions; often the postcondition of one becomes the precondition of the next.

**Restaurant example**

* *Order Food* ‚Üí Post: order placed
* *Eat Food* ‚Üí Pre: order placed and delivered; Post: food eaten
* *Pay for Food* ‚Üí (see short answer below)

<div class="task" markdown="block">

### Short Answer ‚Äî ‚ÄúPay for Food‚Äù

Give reasonable preconditions/postconditions.

**Sample answer:**

* *Preconditions*: Food has been ordered and delivered; the bill is prepared; payment method is available.
* *Postconditions*: Payment is processed; receipt is issued; customer balance due is \$0.

## Agile at a glance

* **Waterfall**: sequential phases; less adaptable to change.
* **Agile (Scrum)**: short 2‚Äì3 week **sprints**, build/test/release small increments; frequent customer feedback ‚Üí highly adaptable.

## Groupwork ‚Äî Preconditions for an online purchase

List **4 steps** (use cases) to purchase a product online (e.g., a Java book) and, for each, write preconditions and postconditions. Typical steps:

1. **Browse/Search Product**

   * Pre: user can access site
   * Post: product page visible

2. **Add to Cart**

   * Pre: product is in stock
   * Post: cart contains product, quantity updated

3. **Checkout**

   * Pre: cart has items; user provides shipping info
   * Post: order summary with totals displayed

4. **Pay**

   * Pre: valid payment method; total calculated
   * Post: payment authorized; order confirmed

Feel free to make a simple use‚Äëcase diagram if you like.

## Summary

* (AP 1.8.A.1) **Comments** help humans; the compiler ignores them. Types: `//`, `/*...*/`, `/**...*/`.
* (AP 1.8.A.2) A **precondition** must be true just before execution; methods may assume it rather than check it.
* (AP 1.8.A.3) A **postcondition** must be true just after execution; it states the outcome (return value or object state).

---

### AP Practice

**Which preconditions are reasonable for:**

```java
/** Adds extra-credit to score. */
public double computeScore(double score, double extraCredit) {
    double totalScore = score + extraCredit;
    return totalScore;
}
```

**Answer:**

* `/* Precondition: score >= 0 */` ‚úÖ
* `/* Precondition: extraCredit >= 0 */` ‚úÖ
  (others are not appropriate)
