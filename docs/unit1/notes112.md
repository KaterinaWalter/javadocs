Java is an **object-oriented programming** language. That means that one of the primary ways of designing and organizing a Java program is in terms of **objects**. Objects combine _data_, and the _code that operates on that data_, into a single unit.

To create objects, we first define a **class** which provides a _template_ for creating the objects. 
> In Java, all programs are built out of classes. This is why every Java program starts with the keywords `public class`.

<div class="task" markdown="block">
 
Print out the Creature coloring sheets and crayons/markers or bring cookie cutters and playdough to class. Ask students to decorate the turtle cutouts or playdough cutouts. Tell them they have all made objects of the Creature class (or other cookie-cutter shapes). Ask them to assign some attributes such as name and color. Ask them to come up with behavior or method names such as goForward and turn.
 
</div>

In this unit, you will learn the vocabulary of object-oriented programming and how to _create_ and _use_ objects of a class written for you. In later units, you will learn to write your own classes.

### Classes & Objects

A class is a **template** for objects of a particular _classification_. You can think of a class as something like:

* A **blueprint** of a house used to construct multiple homes
* A **cookie cutter** used to create cookies
  > The cookie cutter (**class**) can be used to create as many cookies (**objects**) as you want. The cookies are the same shape, but can have different decorations (_attribute values_).

You can also think of a class as **defining a custom data type**. 

In this lesson, we will use the class ``Turtle`` to make animated turtle objects. Just like you use ``int`` to declare variables that hold numbers, you can use ``Turtle`` to declare many variables, animated turtle objects, who are **instances** of the ``Turtle`` class. 

_Example:_
```java
// Declaring 2 Turtle-type objects called yertle and myrtle
Turtle yertle;
Turtle myrtle;
```

### Attributes and Behaviors

A class defines:

* **Attributes** (data)
* **Behaviors** (methods)

**Attributes** are the data an object knows about itself (e.g., a turtle‚Äôs color).
**Behaviors** are the actions an object can perform (e.g., move forward, turn left).

Example: The `Belt` class has 3 instance variables (attributes), and each belt object can have different values for them.

**Think About It:**
What are some attributes of cats? What are some behaviors?

#### CSAwesome Activities: Turtle Class

The `Turtle` class (provided for you) defines attributes (color, position) and behaviors (movement) for turtle objects.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

üê¢ To explore the concepts from this lesson in code, we'll play around with the `Turtle` class on the CSAwesome website instead of taking notes.

## Summary

- (AP 1.12.A.1) A **class** defines a new data type (a classification). It is the formal implementation, or blueprint, of the *attributes* and *behaviors* of the objects of that class.

- (AP 1.12.A.1) An **object** is a specific **instance** of a class with defined attributes. Objects are declared as variables of a class type.

- (AP 1.12.B.1) A variable of a reference type holds an object reference, which can be thought of as the memory address of that object.

- An **attribute** or **instance variable** is data the object knows about itself. For example a turtle object knows the direction it is facing or its color.

- A **behavior** or **method** is something that an object can do.  For example a turtle object can go forward 100 pixels.

- (AP 1.12.A.2) All classes in Java are subclasses of the **Object** class.
