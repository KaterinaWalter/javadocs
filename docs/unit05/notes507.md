## ‚≠êÔ∏è Summary

- Static methods and variables include the keyword static  before their name in the header or declaration. They can be public or private.

- Static variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class sharing a single static variable.

- Static methods are associated with the class, not objects of the class.

- Static variables are used with the class name and the dot operator, since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class.

- Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables, but they can access or change the values of static variables.

- Static methods cannot call non-static methods.
