#### Using a GitHub Template for class notes
{:.no_toc}

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the public template **repository** for our class: [BWL-CS Java Template](https://github.com/BWL-CS/java-template)
2. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Use this template</button> button above the list of files then select `Create a new repository`
3. Specify the **repository name**: `CS2-Unit-5-Notes`
4. Click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Create repository</button>
    > Now you have **your own personal copy** of this starter code that you can always access under the `Your repositories` section of GitHub! 
5. Now on your repository, click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green"> < > Code </button> and select the `Codespaces` tab
6. Click `Create Codespace on main` and wait for the environment to load, _then you're ready to code_!
7. üìù Take notes in this Codespace during class, coding along with the instructor.

## Anatomy of a Java Class

In Unit 2, we learned to use **classes** and **objects** that are built-in to
Java or written by other programmers. In this unit, you will learn to write your
own classes and make your own objects!

Remember that a **class** in Java defines a blueprint for creating objects. When
you create **objects**, you create new **instances** of that class and what you
can do with those instances is determined by what methods are defined in the
class.

For example in Unit 2, we created ``yertle`` and ``myrtle``, 2 ``Turtle``
variables and assigned them references to objects created from the class
``Turtle`` and we used instances of Java‚Äôs ``String`` class to assign values to
different ``String`` variables.

Watch this short video to review the vocabulary of object-oriented programming:

### Creating a Class

Most classes you write will have the keyword ``public`` before them though it is
not required. The class definition itself always starts with the word ``class``
followed by the name of the class. Then the rest of the class, called the body,
is defined inside a pair of ``{ }``s.

Since we‚Äôre talking about anatomy, let‚Äôs create a class called ``Person``.
Classes are almost always named with capitalized names though this is a matter
of style, not a rule of the language. Here is the basic skeleton of a ``Person``
class:

```java
public class Person
{
    // define class here - also called the ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the class

}
```

You can create **instances** of the ``Person`` class with ``new`` as in ``new
Person()`` And you can declare variables that can hold a reference to a
``Person`` object with ``Person variableName``.

Or put it altogether to declare some variables and initialize each one with a
reference to a new ``Person`` as shown here.

```java
Person ada = new Person();
Person charles = new Person();
```

So what makes up the **body** of the class‚Äîthe stuff between the ``{}``s?

{.highlight}
Remember that `objects` have both _attributes_ and _behaviors_. These correspond to
**instance variables** and **methods** in the `class` definition.

The first things we define in a class are usually the instance variables. They
are called that because each instance of the class (each object) has its own set
of variables that aren‚Äôt shared with other instances. This is what allowed
``yertle`` and ``myrtle`` from Unit 2 to be at different positions at the same
time; they each had their own x position and y position instance variables.

The next thing we define in a class is usually its **constructors**. We‚Äôll talk
about writing constructors in more detail in the next section but a
constructor‚Äôs job is to initialize the instance variables when the object is
created. Usually that will mean they need to take arguments. (The call to ``new
Person()`` before is to a constructor that doesn‚Äôt take any arguments. In a
moment we‚Äôll see that our ``Person`` constructor will actually need arguments.)

The real meat of a class is in the **methods** which define the behaviors of the
objects of that class. Recall from Unit 2 that most methods either do things
(like the ``Turtle`` methods that moved the turtle on the screen) or return
values like the ``getXPos`` and ``getYPos`` on ``Turtle``.

The methods of the class share access to the object‚Äôs instance variables and
when a method is called on an object it uses the instance variables for that
object. For example in the ``Turtle`` class the ``forward`` method changes an
instance variable ``xPos``. When you call ``forward`` on ``yertle`` it changes
``xPos`` on the ``yertle`` object and when you call it on ``myrtle`` it changes
the ``xPos`` on the ``myrtle`` object.

Putting it all together, the three main anatomical features of a class are the
**instance variables** which hold values associated with each object, the
**constructors** whose job is to initialize the instance variables, and the
**methods** who contain the code that gives the objects their behavior and which
can use the instance variables defined in the class.

```java
    public class Person
    {
        // instance variables

        // constructors

        // methods

    }
```

And finally one last bit of weird anatomy, kind of like the appendix: any Java
class can have a ``main`` method which can be used to run that class as a
program either to test that one class or sometimes as the entry point to a whole
program made up of many classes and objects.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Summary

- Programmers use code to represent a physical object or nonphysical concept,
  real or imagined, by defining a class based on the attributes and/or behaviors
  of the object or concept.

- **Instance Variables** define the attributes or data needed for objects, and
  **methods** define the behaviors or functions of the object.

- **Data encapsulation** is a technique in which the implementation details of a
  class are kept hidden from the user. The data is kept private with access only
  through the public methods that can act on the data in the class.

- The keywords ``public`` and ``private`` affect the access of classes, data,
  constructors, and methods.

- The keyword ``private`` restricts access to the declaring class, while the
  keyword ``public`` allows access from classes outside the declaring class.

- Instance variables are encapsulated by using the ``private`` **access
  modifier**.

- Methods can be ``public`` or ``private``. The set of ``public`` methods define
  what other classes can do with an instance of a class.
