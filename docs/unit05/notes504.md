## Accessor Methods (_Getters_)

Since the instance variables in a class are usually marked as ``private`` to the
class, if you want code outside the class to be able to access the value of an
instance variable, you need to write what is formally called an **accessor
methods** but which everyone actually just calls a **getter**. 

<div class="imp" markdown="block"> 
  
üëâ A **getter** is a ``public`` method that _takes no arguments_ and _returns the value_ of the
``private`` instance variable. 

```java
class ExampleTemplate
{
  // Instance variable declaration
  private typeOfVar varName;

  // Accessor (getter) method template
  public typeOfVar getVarName()
  {
    return varName;
  }
}
```
</div>
