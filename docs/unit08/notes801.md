#### Using a GitHub Template for class notes 
{:.no_toc}

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the public template **repository** for our class: [BWL-CS Java Template](https://github.com/BWL-CS/java-template)
2. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Use this template</button> button above the list of files then select `Create a new repository`
3. Specify the **repository name**: `CS2-Unit-8-Notes`
4. Click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Create repository</button>
    > Now you have **your own personal copy** of this starter code that you can always access under the `Your repositories` section of GitHub! 
5. Now on your repository, click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green"> < > Code </button> and select the `Codespaces` tab
6. Click `Create Codespace on main` and wait for the environment to load, _then you're ready to code_!
7. üìù Take notes in this Codespace during class, coding along with the instructor.

## Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays

We have only worked with one-dimensional arrays so far, which have a single row of elements. But in the real world, data is often represented in a **two-dimensional table** with **rows** and **columns**. Programming languages can also represent arrays this way with multiple dimensions. A `two-dimensional (2D) array` has _rows_ and _columns_. 
> A 2D array in Java is actually _an array of arrays_!

Arrays in Java can store many items of the same type.  You can even store items in **two-dimensional** (2D) arrays which are arrays that have both **rows** and **columns**.  A **row** has horizontal elements.  A **column** has vertical elements.  In the picture below there are 3 rows of lockers and 6 columns.

Two dimensional arrays are especially useful when the data is naturally organized in rows and columns like in a spreadsheet, bingo, battleship, theater seats, classroom seats, or a picture.  In battleship, letters map to the rows (A is the first row, B is the second row, and so on) and the column indices start with 1.


### Array Storage

Many programming languages actually store two-dimensional array data in nested one-dimensional arrays. The typical way to do this is to store all the data for the first _row_, with each spot referring to a _column_, followed by all the data for the second row, and so on. This is called **row-major** order.  
> Some languages store all the data for the first column followed by all the data for the second column and so on.  This called **column-major** order.

Java actually stores a two-dimensional array as an _array of arrays_. Each element of the **outer** array has a _reference_ to each **inner** array. 

{:.highlight}
The **outer** array can be thought of as the *rows* and the **inner** arrays as the *columns*.

![image](igures/ArrayRowsAndCols.png)

> The picture above shows a 2D array that has 3 *rows* and 7 *columns*. Notice that the array indices start at `0` and end at the `length - 1`.

### Declaring 2D Arrays

To **declare** a 2D array, specify the `type` of elements that will be stored in the array, then double brackets (``[][]``) to show that it is a 2D array of that type, then at least one space, and then a `name` for the array.  

```java
int[][] ticketInfo;
String[][] seatingChart;
```
> Note that the declarations above just name the variable and say what type of array it will reference. *The declarations do not create the array*.  Arrays are **objects** in Java, so any variable that declares an array holds a **reference** to an object. If the array hasn't been created yet and you try to print the value of the variable, it will print `null` (meaning it doesn't reference any object yet).

To **create** an array use the `new` keyword, followed by a space, then the type, and then the number of rows in square brackets followed by the number of columns in square brackets, like this ``new int[numRows][numCols]``.

```java
ticketInfo = new int[2][3];
seatingChart = new String[3][2];
```
> The code above creates a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns named ``ticketInfo`` and a 2D array with 3 rows and 2 columns named ``seatingChart``.

{:.highlight}
The **total** number of elements in a 2D array is the _number of rows_ **times** the _number of columns_.

### Set Value(s) in a 2D Array

When arrays are created, their contents are automatically **initialized** to `0` for numeric types, `null` for object references, and `false` for type boolean. 

<div class="imp" markdown="block">
    
To explicitly **set a value** in a 2D array, you can use _assignment statements_ with the `name` of the array followed by the `row` index in square brackets followed by the `column` index in square brackets, and then an ``=`` followed by a value:

```java
// 
int[][] data = new int[2][3];
// 
data[0][0] = 15;
```

</div>

### Initializer Lists for 2D Arrays

You can also **initialize (set)** the values for the array when you first create it.  In this case you _don't need to specify the size_ of the array, it will be determined from the values you give.  

<div class="imp" markdown="block">
    
The code below uses an **initializer list** to create a value-filled array called ``ticketInfo`` with 2 rows and 3 columns. It also creates an array called ``seatingInfo`` with 3 rows and 2 columns.

```java
int[][] ticketInfo = { {25,20,25}, {25,20,25} };
String[][] seatingInfo = { {"Jamal", "Maria"}, {"Jake", "Suzy"}, {"Emma", "Luke"} };
```

</div>
> üí¨ **DISCUSS:** What is the value at ``seatingInfo[2][1]`` after the code above executes?

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Summary

- A 2D array is stored as _an array of arrays_. And the way 2D arrays are **created** and **indexed** is similar to 1D array objects.

- 2D arrays are declared and created with the following syntax: ``datatype[][] variableName = new datatype[numberRows][numberCols];``

- For the purposes of the exam, when accessing the element at ``arr[first][second]``, the ``first`` index is used for **rows**, the ``second`` index is used for **columns**.

- The **initializer list** used to create and initialize a 2D array consists of initializer lists that represent 1D arrays.
    - For example, ``int[][] ticketInfo = { {25,20,25}, {25,20,25} };``

- The square brackets ``[row][col]`` are used to **access** and **modify** an element in a 2D array.

- **"Row-major order"** refers to an ordering of 2D array elements where traversal occurs across each row, while "column-major order" traversal occurs down each column.
