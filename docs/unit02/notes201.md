#### Using a GitHub Template for class notes
{:.no_toc}

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the public template **repository** for our class: [BWL-CS Java Template](https://github.com/BWL-CS/java-template)
2. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Use this template</button> button above the list of files then select `Create a new repository`
3. Specify the **repository name**: `CS2-Unit-2-Notes`
4. Click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Create repository</button>
    > Now you have **your own personal copy** of this starter code that you can always access under the `Your repositories` section of GitHub! 
5. Now on your repository, click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green"> < > Code </button> and select the `Codespaces` tab
6. Click `Create Codespace on main` and wait for the environment to load, _then you're ready to code_!
7. üìù Take notes in this Codespace during class, coding along with the instructor.

## Objects are Instances of Classes

Java is an **object-oriented programming** language. That means that one of the
primary ways of organizing our programs is in terms of **objects**. Objects are
a kind of value that combines data and the code that operates on that data into
a single unit. Objects are defined in Java by writing **classes** which provide
a blueprint for creating objects of a certain kind, describing the data and code
that all **instances** of that class have.

Sometimes classes and objects are used to model things in the real world, such
as if we made a ``Student`` class to represent students in a school. Other times
classes are just ways of organizing different parts of our programs that may not
correspond to anything in the world outside the computer.

But in Java all programs are built out of classes. This is why, as you saw in
Unit 1, every Java programs starts with ``public class``: the first thing we
have to do when we write a Java program is define at least one class.

### What are Objects and Classes?

**Objects** are values created by **constructing** an **instance** of a
**class**. We used ``String`` objects in Unit 1 and variables declared of type
``String`` such as ``String name;``. In this unit we'll work with a new class,
``Turtle`` which creates  animated turtles. Later on, in Unit 5, you'll
learn to write your own classes.

When you think about making objects from a class, you can think of a class like a
blueprint or a cookie cutter. It is used to create the cookies (objects) and can
be used to create as many cookies (objects) as you want. As a blueprint, each
class defines the **attributes** its objects have (the properties or what each
object knows about itself) and the **behaviors** (what each object can do). In
Java code, the attributes are written as **instance variables** in the class,
and the behaviors are written as **methods**.

You can also think of a class defining a new type. Just like you use ``int`` to
declare variables that can hold an whole number value, you can use ``Turtle`` to
declare a variable whose value has to be an instance of the ``Turtle`` class.
And just like the Java compiler will only let you do things with the values of
``int`` variables that make sense (like adding and multiplying them), it will
only let you do things with values of a ``Turtle`` variable that make sense to do
with turtles, namely accessing the instance variables and methods defined in the
``Turtle`` class.

The following picture has lots of cats (objects of the type cat). They are all
different, but they share the same attributes and behaviors that make up a cat.
They are all **instances** of cat with different values for their attributes.
Name some of the attributes and behaviors of the cats below. For example, the
color (*attribute*) of the first cat is black (*attribute value*) and it is
playing (*behavior*).

<div class="task" markdown="block">

üí¨ **Discuss with your class:** What are some attributes of cats? What are some behaviors of cats?

* **Attributes** are often _nouns_ or _adjectives_ describing features
* **Behaviors** are often _verbs_

### Intro to Objects with Turtles

The `Turtle` class (which was written for you) is a **blueprint** for turtle objects. It defines **attributes** for graphical turtles like their `color` and `position`, and **methods** to make the turtles `move`. The Java program below creates a Turtle **object** called yertle using the Turtle **class**: 

```java
public class TurtleTest
    {
        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            World habitat = new World(300, 300);
            Turtle yertle = new Turtle(habitat);

            yertle.forward();
            yertle.turnLeft();
            yertle.forward();

            habitat.show(true);
        }
    }
```

#### DOT OPERATOR `.`

The **dot operator** `.` is used to call üì£ an object's method. You can think of the `.` as _commanding_ the object to do something (execute one of its methods). For example, ``yertle.forward()`` asks the turtle ``yertle`` to go ``forward``. It doesn't tell ``yertle`` how much to go forward, so it goes forward 100 pixels by default. 

The parentheses ``()`` after a method name are there in case you need to give the method **arguments** (some data) to do its job.

> For example: to go forward 50 pixels instead of 100 in ``yertle.forward(50);`` 

#### CLASS DIAGRAM

Here is a **class diagram** that shows some of the attributes and methods in the class ``Turtle``:

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Summary

- A **class** defines a _new data type_ (a classification). It is the formal implementation, or _blueprint_, of the **attributes** and **behaviors** of the objects of that class.

- An **object** is a specific **instance** of a class with defined attributes. Objects are declared as variables of a class type.

- An **attribute** or **instance variable** is data the object knows about itself.
    - _For example:_ a Turtle object knows the direction it is facing or its color.

- A **behavior** or **method** is something that an object can do.
    - _For example:_ a Turtle object can go forward 100 pixels.
