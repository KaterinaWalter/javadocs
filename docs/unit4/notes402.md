## Data Sets

A **data set** is a collection of specific pieces of information or data. For example, the following table is a data set that keeps track of information about students. Data can be represented in a diagram by using a chart or table. Here it is shown as a spreadsheet table with columns for the first name, last name, email, and GPA. 

**Spreadsheet** software like Excel and Google Sheets store data in a _table_, and provide functions to manipulate and calculate with the data. 

| firstname | lastname | email                 | GPA |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------|-----|
| Mickey    | Mouse    | mickey@disney.com     | 3.5 |
| Minnie    | Mouse    | minnie@disney.com     | 4.0 |
| Donald    | Duck     | donald@disney.com     | 3.0 |

Data sets can be _manipulated_ and _analyzed_ to solve a problem or answer a question. Data in a table or chart can be used to plan the algorithm that will be used to manipulate the data. 
> For example, how would you find the average GPA of the students in the table above? You would need to access each GPA value in the table and then add them up and then divide by the number of rows.

When analyzing data sets, **values** within the set are accessed and utilized one at a time and then processed according to the desired outcome. Loops can be used to access and process each value in a data set. Let's practice this with pseudocode.

<div class="task" markdown="block">
    
Write *pseudocode* for an _algorithm_ that prints out the names of students with a GPA of 3.5 or higher given a table of student data where one column is the GPA. Make sure you use **repetition** (loop) and **selection** (if) in your algorithm.

</div>

In the next lessons, we will learn about **data structures** like Java arrays that can be used to store data sets. We will use loops to access and manipulate the data in the arrays. 

## ⭐️ Summary

- (AP 4.2.A.1)	A **data set** is a collection of specific pieces of information or data.
- (AP 4.2.A.2) Data sets can be manipulated and analyzed to solve a problem or answer a question. When analyzing data sets, values within the set are accessed and utilized one at a time and then processed according to the desired outcome.
- (AP 4.2.A.3) Data can be represented in a diagram by using a chart or table. This visual can be used to plan the algorithm that will be used to manipulate the data.
