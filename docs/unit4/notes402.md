## Data Sets

A **data set** is a collection of specific pieces of information or data. For example, the following table is a data set that keeps track of information about students. Data can be represented in a diagram by using a chart or table. Here it is shown as a spreadsheet table with columns for the first name, last name, email, and GPA.

Spreadsheet software like Excel and Google Sheets store data in a table and provide functions to manipulate and calculate with the data.

| firstname | lastname | email                 | GPA |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------|-----|
| Mickey    | Mouse    | mickey@disney.com     | 3.5 |
| Minnie    | Mouse    | minnie@disney.com     | 4.0 |
| Donald    | Duck     | donald@disney.com     | 3.0 |
| *(your row here)* |  |  |     |
