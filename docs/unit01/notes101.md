## About the AP CS A Exam

This curriculum will prepare you for the _Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam_ which tests your programming skills in **Java**.

The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections: **multiple choice** and
**free response**. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
first part has 40 multiple-choice questions, and the second part has 4 free
response questions where you have to write Java code by hand. üìù Each part is worth
50% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the [AP CSA
Reference Sheet](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf).

For more information on the exam see the College Board [AP CSA site](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a). The College Board provides a question bank and formative assessment quizzes for each unit online
for registered AP classes.

Also check out this list of [CS Careers](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/choosing-courses/major-career-results/course/AP-Computer-Science-A) that taking CSA can lead to. Learning
to code is an increasingly important skill that has applications in many
careers!

## Java Development Environments
The tool that we use to compile a Java **source** file into a Java **class** file is called a `compiler`. Most programmers use an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** that has the compiler built in and helps you write, compile, run, and debug programs.

### GitHub Classroom and Codespaces

Github provides many free opportunities for students and teachers (_unlike Replit_). [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) allows teachers to set up a classroom group based on Github repositories. Github and `git` are widely used in the computer industry, so learning to use it is great experience for students. Github now has a cloud (online) **IDE** called [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) which you can use completely free if you join as a school or get approved as a teacher or student. 

_In Codespaces, you can:_
* Start from a **blank template** or a **repository** ("repo")
* Open a `.java` file in the VSCode editor
* Follow prompts to install the **Java Extension Pack**
* Click on the `Run and Debug` (play button ‚ñ∂Ô∏è)
* Follow the prompts to install the Java **debugger**
* See the **output** of your code in the `terminal`


#### GitHub Account Setup

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. **Go to:** [GitHub Sign Up](https://github.com/signup)
2. Enter your `@gbwl.org` **school email**
3. Create a **password** that you'll remember 
4. Enter a **username** that follows this pattern: `FirstName` `LastInitial` `GradYear`
    > _For example:_ `KaterinaN2014`
    > 
    > DO NOT include your entire last name (_privacy reasons_)
5. After verifying your account, **let me know** so I can add you to the GitHub Classroom group!
6. Once everyone is ready, we'll follow this **tutorial**: [GitHub Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world)
