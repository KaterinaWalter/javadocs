## About the AP CS A Exam

This curriculum will prepare you for the _Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam_ which tests your programming skills in **Java**.

The AP CSA exam is 3 hours long and has two sections: **multiple choice** and
**free response**. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part. The
first part has 40 multiple-choice questions, and the second part has 4 free
response questions where you have to write Java code by hand. üìù Each part is worth
50% of your grade. During the exam, you will have access to the [AP CSA
Reference Sheet](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf).

For more information on the exam see the College Board [AP CSA site](https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a). The College Board provides a question bank and formative assessment quizzes for each unit online
for registered AP classes.

Also check out this list of [CS Careers](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/choosing-courses/major-career-results/course/AP-Computer-Science-A) that taking CSA can lead to. Learning
to code is an increasingly important skill that has applications in many
careers!

## What is Java?

## Java Development Environments
The tool that we use to compile a Java source file into a Java class file is called a compiler. Most programmers use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has the compiler built in and helps you write, compile, run, and debug programs.

### Github Classroom and Codespaces
Github provides many free opportunities for students and teachers (https://docs.github.com/en/education/quickstart). Github Classroom (https://classroom.github.com/) allows teachers to set up a classroom based on github repositories. Github and git are widely used in the computer industry, so learning to use it is great experience for students. Github now has a cloud IDE called Codespaces (https://github.com/features/codespaces) which you can use for 60 hours a month for free or completely free if you join as a school or get approved as a teacher or student. In Codespaces, you can start from a blank template or a repo, open a .java file in the VSCode editor, follow prompts to install the Extension Pack for Java, click on the Run and Debug (play button), follow the prompts to install the Java debugger, and see the output of your code in the terminal. 

Students will need to sign up for a free Github account (https://github.com/signup) if they don‚Äôt already have one in order to use Codespaces.
