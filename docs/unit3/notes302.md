## Impacts of Computing

Computing innovations affect the **economy**, **society**, and **culture** in both positive and negative ways. Understanding these impacts helps us create technology that benefits people while minimizing harm.

---

## Examples of Positive Impacts

- **Communication**: Instant messaging, video calls, and social media connect people worldwide.
- **Healthcare**: AI-assisted diagnostics, telemedicine, and health tracking devices improve outcomes.
- **Education**: Online learning platforms expand access to knowledge.

---

## Examples of Negative Impacts

- **Privacy concerns**: Personal data collection and misuse.
- **Job displacement**: Automation reducing demand for certain roles.
- **Digital divide**: Unequal access to technology and the internet.

---

## Ethical Considerations

Programmers and tech companies have a responsibility to consider:

- **Bias in algorithms**
- **Environmental effects** of manufacturing and disposing devices
- **Security risks** from poorly designed systems

---

## Open Access and Sharing

Some computing innovations use **open source** models, allowing anyone to view, use, and improve the code. This promotes collaboration but may raise security and intellectual property concerns.

---

## Example: GPS

- **Positive impact**: Enables precise navigation for individuals, businesses, and emergency services.
- **Negative impact**: Can be used for unwanted tracking and privacy invasion.

---

## Summary

- Computing impacts can be **positive** or **negative** in economic, social, and cultural contexts.
- Ethical issues like **bias, privacy, and security** must be considered.
- Open source encourages collaboration but introduces risks.
