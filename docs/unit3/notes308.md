**Scope** refers to where a variable can be _accessed_ in a program.  
**Access modifiers** determine which parts of a program can use a variable or method.



## Variable Scope

- **Local variables**: Declared inside a method, only accessible within that method.
- **Instance variables**: Declared inside a class but outside any method, accessible to all methods in that class.
- **Class (static) variables**: Declared with `static`, shared by all objects.

Example:

```java
public class Example {
    private int instanceVar = 10; // instance scope

    public void method() {
        int localVar = 5; // local scope
        System.out.println(localVar);
    }
}
````

## Access Modifiers

* `public`: Accessible from any other class.
* `private`: Accessible only within the same class.
* `protected`: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
* No modifier: Package-private (accessible only within the same package).

---

## Example

```java
public class Person {
    public String name;       // public: accessible anywhere
    private int age;          // private: only inside this class

    public Person(String n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    public int getAge() {     // provides controlled access
        return age;
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices

* Keep variables **private** and use getter/setter methods to control access.
* Use the most restrictive access modifier possible to reduce unintended interactions.

---

## Summary

* **Scope**: Where a variable exists and can be used.
* **Access modifiers**: Control who can see or modify a variable or method.
* Favor `private` for encapsulation and maintainability.
