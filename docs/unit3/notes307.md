In Java, the keyword `static` means a variable or method belongs to the **class** rather than to individual objects.

## Static Variables

- Shared by all objects of the class.
- Only one copy exists, regardless of how many objects are created.
- Can be used for **constants** or **counters**.

Example:

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private static int studentCount = 0;

    public Student(String n) {
        name = n;
        studentCount++;
    }

    public static int getStudentCount() {
        return studentCount;
    }
}
````

Usage:

```java
Student s1 = new Student("Alex");
Student s2 = new Student("Jordan");
System.out.println(Student.getStudentCount()); // prints 2
```

---

## Static Methods

* Can be called without creating an object.
* Cannot access **instance variables** directly (since they belong to objects, not the class).
* Often used for utility methods.

Example:

```java
public class MathHelper {
    public static int square(int num) {
        return num * num;
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
int result = MathHelper.square(5); // returns 25
```

## Summary

* **Static variables**: Shared data for all objects of the class.
* **Static methods**: Called on the class itself, not an object.
* Useful for constants, counters, and utility methods.
