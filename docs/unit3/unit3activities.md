## ACTIVITY #1: Class Pet 🐶🐱🐹🐰🐸

You've been hired to create a software system for the Awesome Animal Clinic! They would like to keep track of their animal patients. Here are some **attributes** (_data/fields/instance variables_) of the pets that they would like to track:

- `name`
- `age`
- `weight`
- `type` (dog, cat, lizard, etc.)
- `breed`

Your task is to write a complete `class` that defines a `Pet` object to keep track of pet records at the animal clinic. Your class must include all the key _object-defining class_ components covered so far: **instance variables**, **constructors**, **accessor/getter methods**, a **toString** **method**, and **mutator/setter methods**.

### PART A:

<div class="task" markdown="block">

- [ ] First declare what **instance variables** are needed in the `class` and their data types.
  > Make sure you use ``int``, ``double``, and ``String`` data types. Make the instance variables ``private``.

- [ ] Write a **constructor** with many parameters to initialize values for all the instance variables.

- [ ] Write **accessor/getter** **methods** for each of the instance variables.

- [ ] Write a ``toString`` **method** that returns a text string of the data in a ``Pet`` record.

- [ ] Write **mutator/setter** **methods** for each of the instance variables.

- [ ] In the ``main`` method, **test** your object class: create 2 new ``Pet`` objects with different values
   and call the constructor, accessor methods, mutator methods, and ``toString`` methods to test all your code.
