üìù Take notes in a **Codespace** during class, coding along with the instructor.

1. Go to GitHub and click on your picture in the _TOP RIGHT_ corner
2. Select `Your repositories`
3. Open `CS2-Unit-4-Notes`
5. Now on your repository, click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green"> < > Code </button> and select the `Codespaces` tab
6. Click `Create Codespace on main` (unless you already have one listed there), wait for the environment to load, _then you're ready to code_!

## Nested For Loops

A **nested loop** has _one loop inside of another_. These are typically used for working with two dimensions such as printing stars in rows and columns as shown below:

When a loop is nested inside another loop, the inner loop runs many times inside the outer loop. In each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop will be re-started. The inner loop must finish all of its iterations before the outer loop can continue to its next iteration.

What does the following code print out? Watch the code run in the [Java visualizer](). Notice how the inner loop is started over for each row. Can you predict how many rows and columns of stars there will be?

```java
for (int row = 1; row <= 3; row++)
           {
               for (int col = 1; col <= 5; col++)
               {
                   System.out.print("*");
               }
               System.out.println();
           }
```
> Can you change the code to print a rectangle with 10 rows and 8 columns of stars? You can also try replacing line 10 with this print statement to see the rows and columns: ``System.out.print(row + "-" + col + " ");``

üõë When class ends, don't forget to **SAVE YOUR WORK**!

1. Navigate to the `Source Control` menu on the _LEFT_ sidebar
2. Type a brief **commit message** in the box, for example: `updated Main.java`
3. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">commit changes</button> button on the _LEFT_ menu
4. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">sync changes</button> button on the _LEFT_ menu
5. _Finally you can close your Codespace!_
