#### Using a GitHub Template for class notes
{:.no_toc}

<div class="setup" markdown="block">

1. Go to the public template **repository** for our class: [BWL-CS Java Template](https://github.com/BWL-CS/java-template)
2. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Use this template</button> button above the list of files then select `Create a new repository`
3. Specify the **repository name**: `CS2-Unit-7-Notes`
4. Click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">Create repository</button>
    > Now you have **your own personal copy** of this starter code that you can always access under the `Your repositories` section of GitHub! 
5. Now on your repository, click <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green"> < > Code </button> and select the `Codespaces` tab
6. Click `Create Codespace on main` and wait for the environment to load, _then you're ready to code_!
7. üìù Take notes in this Codespace during class, coding along with the instructor.

## Intro to ArrayLists

In the last unit, we learned about using arrays to hold **collections** of related data. However arrays are not very _flexible_. Most notably, the size of an array is established at the time of creation and cannot be changed. What if you **don't know how big** the collection of data will be? What if you want to both **add** and **remove** items from a collection? 
> For example, if you wanted to represent a shopping list, you might _add to the list_ throughout the week and _remove things from the list_ while you are shopping. You probably would not know how many items will be on the list at the beginning of the week.

You can use ``ArrayList`` instead of arrays whenever you don't know the size of the array you need or you know that you will add and remove items and may need to change the array‚Äôs size _dynamically_ during run time. An ``ArrayList`` is **mutable**, meaning it can change during run time by adding and removing objects from it.

  <dd>A re-sizable collection. It is called <code>ArrayList</code> because it stores the items that have been added to it in an underlying <strong>array</strong>. But it also takes care of keeping track of how many items have been added to the array and it will create a new bigger array under the covers when needed to hold more items.

### Packages and Imports

---

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Summary

- ``ArrayList``s are re-sizable lists that allow adding and removing items to
  change their size during run time.

- The ``ArrayList`` class is in the ``java.util`` package. You must import
  ``java.util.ArrayList`` or ``java.util.*`` to use it.

- An ``ArrayList`` object contains object references and is mutable, meaning it
  can change (by adding and removing items from it).

- The ``ArrayList`` constructor ``ArrayList()`` constructs an empty list of size 0.

- Java allows the generic type ``ArrayList<E>``, where the generic type ``E``
  specifies the type of the elements, like ``String`` or ``Integer``. Without
  it, the type will be ``Object``.

- ``ArrayList<E>`` is preferred over ``ArrayList`` because it allows the
  compiler to find errors that would otherwise be found at run time.

- When ``ArrayList<E>`` is specified, the types of the reference parameters and
  return type when using its methods are type ``E``.

- ``ArrayList``s cannot hold primitive types like ``int`` or ``double``, so
  you must use the wrapper classes ``Integer`` or ``Double`` to put numerical
  values into an ``ArrayList``. However autoboxing usually takes care of that
  for you.

üõë When class ends, don't forget to **SAVE YOUR WORK**!

1. Navigate to the `Source Control` menu on the _LEFT_ sidebar
2. Type a brief **commit message** in the box, for example: `updated Main.java`
3. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">commit changes</button> button on the _LEFT_ menu
4. Click the <button type="button" name="button" class="btn btn-green">sync changes</button> button on the _LEFT_ menu
5. _Finally you can close your Codespace!_
