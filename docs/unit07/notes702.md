## ArrayList Methods

The following are the ``ArrayList`` methods that you need to know for the AP CSA exam. These are included on the <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf" target="_blank">AP CSA Java Quick Reference Sheet</a> that you will receive during the exam so you do not need to memorize them. 
> **NOTE:** The `E` in the method headers below stands for the type of the element in the ArrayList; this type `E` can be any Object type.

-  `int size()` returns the **number of elements** in the list

-  `boolean add(E obj)` **appends** obj to the *end* of the list, and also returns true

-  `void add(int index, E obj)` **inserts** obj at the index, moves any current objects at index or beyond to the _right_ (to a higher index), and also returns the replaced element

-  `E remove(int index)` **removes** the item at the index, shifts remaining items to the _left_ (to a lower index), and also returns the replaced element

-  `E get(int index)` returns the **item** in the list at the index

-  `E set(int index, E obj)` **replaces** the item at index with obj, and also returns the replaced element

### ``size()``

As we saw in the last lesson, you can get the **number of items** in a ``ArrayList`` using its ``size()`` method. The ``ArrayList`` starts out empty with a size of 0.

```java
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
System.out.println( list.size() );
```

{:.highlight}
With arrays, you use the ``length`` field to get the number of items in the array. But, with an ``ArrayList`` you use the ``size()`` method to get the number of items in the ``ArrayList``. The number of items in an empty ``ArrayList`` is 0.
> **AP EXAM NOTE:** You will not be penalized if you mix up ``length`` and ``size()`` in the CSA exam.

### ``add(obj)``

You can **add** values to an ``ArrayList`` using the method ``add(obj)``, which will add the object to the _end_ of the list, just like you would join the end of the line to board a bus.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

Try the code below to see how the list **changes** as each object is added to the end. 

```java
ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
nameList.add("Diego");
System.out.println(nameList);
nameList.add("Grace");
System.out.println(nameList);
System.out.println(nameList.size());
```
> Can you add your name to the list and then print out the list?

</div>

When adding Integers to a list, you can use the `Integer` object constructor like ``add(new Integer(5))``... but you can also just add the primitive `int` value directly, like ``add(5)``, and it will be changed into an ``Integer`` object automatically. 
> üì¶ This is called **autoboxing**. When you pull an ``int`` value out of a list of ``Integers``, that is called **unboxing**.

{:.highlight}
You can put any kind of **objects** into an ``ArrayList``. Even instances of a class that you wrote! 

For example, here is an ``ArrayList`` of ``Creature``s:
```java
ArrayList<Creature> zoo = new ArrayList<Creature>();
zoo.add(new Creature("Bella", "Unicorn", 15));
zoo.add(new Creature("Bobby", "Bear", 8));
```

### ``add(index,obj)``

There are actually two different ``add`` methods in the ``ArrayList`` class:
1. The ``add(obj)`` method **adds** the passed object to the _end_ of the list.
2. The ``add(index,obj)`` method **inserts** the passed object at the passed `index`, but first _shifts over_ any existing values to higher indices to make room for the new object.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

üí¨ **DISCUSS:** What will the code below print out? Try figuring it out before running it.
> Remember that `ArrayList`s start at index 0 and that the `add(index,obj)` always takes the index as the first argument.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list1.add(1);
// adds the number 2 to the end of the list
list1.add(2);
// This will add the number 3 at index 1
list1.add(1, 3);
// This will add the number 4 at index 1
list1.add(1, 4);
System.out.println(list1);
System.out.println(list1.size());
```

</div>

### ``remove(index)``

You can also **remove** values from an ``ArrayList`` using the ``remove(index)`` method. It removes the item located at the specified _index_, which affects the underlying array in two ways: all of the other items after that index shift to a lower index, and the size of the ``ArrayList`` is decreased by 1.
> Note that this method is **NON-VOID**: It also _returns_ the item that was removed... in case you need to see it (but usually you don't).

<div class="task" markdown="block">

üí¨ **DISCUSS:** What will the code below print out? Try figuring it out before running it.

```java
ArrayList<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
list2.add(1);
list2.add(2);
list2.add(3);
list2.remove(1);
System.out.println(list2);
```
> The ``remove(int index)`` method doesn't remove the object that matches the integer value given. In the example above it doesn't remove the value `1` ‚Äì it removes the value `2` at **index** `1`.

</div>

### ``get(index)`` and ``set(index, obj)``

You can **get** the object at an index using ``obj = listName.get(index)`` and **set**
the object at an index using ``listName.set(index,obj)``. Both methods require
that the index argument refer to an existing element of the list, i.e. the index
must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than the ``size()`` of the list.

{:.highlight}
Notice that ``ArrayList``s use ``get`` and ``set`` **methods** instead of the `index` **operator** that we use with arrays: ``array[index]``. This is because ``ArrayList`` is an object **class** with *methods*, not a built in type with special support in the language like arrays are.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

```java
ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
nameList.add("Diego");
nameList.add("Grace");
nameList.add("Deja");
System.out.println(nameList.get(0));
System.out.println(nameList.get(1));
nameList.set(1, "John");
System.out.println(nameList);
```
> Can you get the _last_ element in the `nameList` to print it out? Can you set the _first_ element in the list to your name and print out the list?

</div>

### Comparing Arrays and ArrayLists

When do you use arrays and when do you use ``ArrayList``s? Use an array when
you want to store several items of the same type and you know how many items
will be in the array and the items in the array won't change in order or number.
Use an ``ArrayList`` when you want to store several items of the same type and
you don't know how many items you will need in the list or when you want to
remove items from the list or add items to the list while the program is
running.

Here is a comparison of how to create Arrays and ``ArrayList``s:

```java
// Arrays must specify a size!
int[] highScores = new int[5];
String[] names = new String[5];

// ArrayLists are empty to start with
ArrayList<Integer> highScoreList = new ArrayList<Integer>();
ArrayList<String> nameList = new ArrayList<String>();
```

Here is a comparison of how to access and change elements in arrays and
``ArrayList``\ s. Note that ``ArrayList``\ s have a method ``size()`` instead of a
``length`` property, and ``ArrayList``\ s use ``get``/``set`` methods instead of
the index operator (``[]``).

=========== ========================  ========================
Operation   array                     ArrayList
=========== ========================  ========================
length/size array.length              list.size()
----------- ------------------------  ------------------------
Access      value = array[index];     value = list.get(index);
----------- ------------------------  ------------------------
Modify      array[index] = value;     list.set(index,value);
=========== ========================  ========================

Note that the ``ArrayList`` methods ``add`` and ``remove`` do not have a simple
equivalent in arrays because they change the number of elements in the list and
may shift the positions of other elements.

#### üíª In-Class Activity
{:.no_toc}

<div class="task" markdown="block">

üí¨ **DISCUSS:** Why might an `ArrayList` be a more appropriate _data structure_ than an `array` for a **To Do list**?

For each of the following tasks, rewrite the given code to use an `ArrayList` instead of an `array`.

1. Create and populate the data structure:
  ```java
  String[] toDoList = new String[3];
  toDoList[0] = "Do homework";
  toDoList[1] = "Help make dinner";
  toDoList[2] = "Call grandma";
  ```
2. Replace an element at a specified index:
  ```java
  toDoList[1] = "Order pizza";
  ```
3. Check the number of items:
  ```java
  System.out.println(toDoList.length + " things to do!");
  ```
5. Access a value at a specified index:
  ```java
  System.out.println("Here's the first thing to do: " + toDoList[0]);
  ```
4. Remove the first item and shift everything down:
  ```java
  toDoList[0] = toDoList[1];
  toDoList[1] = toDoList[2];
  toDoList[2] = "";
  ```
  > **HINT:** this can all be done in _one method call_ with ArrayList!
