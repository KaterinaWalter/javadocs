## Array Algorithms (FRQs)

In this lesson, you will study different Free Response Questions and responses that develop algorithms using arrays.


Here are some common algorithms that you should be familiar with for the AP CSA exam:

- Determine the minimum or maximum value in an array
- Compute a sum, average, or mode of array elements
- Search for a particular element in the array
- Determine if at least one element has a particular property
- Determine if all elements have a particular property
- Access all consecutive pairs of elements
- Determine the presence or absence of duplicate elements
- Determine the number of elements meeting specific criteria
- Shift or rotate elements left or right
- Reverse the order of the elements

üîÅ Here are two common **array traversal loops** that can be used for these algorithms:

  ```java
  for (int value : array) {
      if (value ....)
          ...
  }
  ```
  > **Enhanced for** (for-each) loops visit _EVERY ITEM_!
  ```java
  for(int i=0; i < array.length; i++)
  {
     if (array[i] ....)
         ...
  }
  ```
  > **Standard for** loops offer more flexibility, and keep track of the _INDEX_.
