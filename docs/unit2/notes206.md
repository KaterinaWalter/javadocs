## Comparing Booleans

You can compare booleans directly with `==` and `!=`.  
- `==` checks if two boolean values are equal.  
- `!=` checks if they are not equal.

**Coding Exercise: Boolean Comparison**

Test both `true` and `false` values for `isSunny` and `isWarm`.

```java
boolean isSunny = true;
boolean isWarm = false;

if (isSunny == true) {
    System.out.println("It's sunny");
}

if (isWarm != true) {
    System.out.println("It's not warm");
}
````

</div>

## Logical Equivalences

Certain boolean expressions can be rewritten without changing their meaning. This is useful for simplifying logic and avoiding common mistakes.

Example:

```java
!(x < 5)
```

is equivalent to:

```java
x >= 5
```

## De Morgan‚Äôs Laws

De Morgan‚Äôs Laws show how to distribute `!` (NOT) over `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR):

1. `!(A && B)` is the same as `!A || !B`
2. `!(A || B)` is the same as `!A && !B`

**Mnemonic:** Negating flips the operator and negates each condition.

---

### Example 1

```java
!(x > 0 && y > 0)
```

is equivalent to:

```java
x <= 0 || y <= 0
```

---

### Example 2

```java
!(x > 0 || y > 0)
```

is equivalent to:

```java
x <= 0 && y <= 0
```

## Practice with De Morgan‚Äôs Laws

<div class="task" markdown="block">

**Coding Exercise: Applying De Morgan**

Rewrite each condition using De Morgan‚Äôs Laws.

```java
boolean raining = true;
boolean cold = false;

if (!(raining && cold)) {
    System.out.println("Nice weather");
}

if (!(raining || cold)) {
    System.out.println("Perfect weather");
}
```

* First if: `!raining || !cold`
* Second if: `!raining && !cold`

</div>

## Summary

* Use `==` and `!=` to compare booleans directly.
* Negating a compound condition flips the operator (`&&` ‚Üî `||`) and negates each part.
* De Morgan‚Äôs Laws are helpful for simplifying conditions and avoiding logic errors.

<summary><strong>Question 1</strong></summary>

Which of the following is equivalent to `!(a && b)`?

A. `!a || !b`

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2</strong></summary>

Which of the following is equivalent to `!(a || b)`?

A. `!a || !b`
B. `!a && !b`
C. `a && b`

**Answer:** **B** ‚Äî De Morgan‚Äôs Law: `!(A || B)` ‚â° `!A && !B`.
