## Compound Boolean Expressions

### And (`&&`) Operator

What if you want **two things to be true** before the body of the conditional is executed?  Use ``&&`` as a logical **and** to join two Boolean expressions and the body of the condition will only be executed only if both are true.

<div class="task" markdown="block">
  
What if you want to go out and your parents say you can go out if you clean your room and do your homework? Test the code below and try different values for ``cleanedRoom`` and ``didHomework`` and see what they have to be for it to print ``"You can go out"``.
```java
boolean cleanedRoom = true;
boolean didHomework = false;

if (cleanedRoom && didHomework) {
  System.out.println("You can go out");
}
else {
  System.out.println("No, you can't go out");
}
```

</div>

### Or (`||`) Operator

What if it is okay if _only one of two things_ is true? Use ``||`` as a logical **or** to join two Boolean expressions and the body of the condition will be executed if one or both are true.

<div class="task" markdown="block">
  
For example, your parents might say you can go out if you can walk or they don't need the car.  Try different values for ``walking`` and ``carIsAvailable`` and see what the values have to be to print ``"You can go out"``.
```java
boolean walking = false;
boolean carIsAvailable = false;

if (walking || carIsAvailable) {
  System.out.println("You can go out");
}
else {
  System.out.println("No, you can't go out");
}
```

</div>

### Not (`!`) Operator

The **not** (``!``) operator can be used to negate a boolean value. We've seen ``!`` before in ``!=`` (not equal).  

<div class="task" markdown="block">

The code below says if homework is _not_ done, you can't go out. Try different values for ``homeworkDone``.
```java
boolean homeworkDone = false;
if (!homeworkDone) {
  System.out.println("Sorry, you can't go out!");
}
```

</div>

{:.warning}
If you use ``!`` in expressions with ``&&`` and ``||``, be careful because the results are often the opposite of what you think it will be at first. We'll see examples of this in the next lesson.

{:.highlight}
In Java, `!` will be executed before `&&`, and `&&` will be executed before `||`, unless there are **parentheses**. Anything inside parentheses is executed first.

### Truth Tables

#### AND (&&) TRUTH TABLE
{:.no_toc}

The following table (also called a **truth table**) shows the result for ``P && Q`` when ``P`` and ``Q`` are both expressions that can be ``true`` or ``false``. An expression involving logical operators like ``P && Q`` evaluates to a ``boolean`` value, ``true`` or ``false``. As you can see below the result of ``P && Q`` is only ``true`` if both ``P`` and ``Q`` are ``true``.

| P     | Q     | P `&&` Q  |
|-------|-------|-----------|
|true   |true   |true       |
|true   |false  |false      |
|false  |true   |???        |
|false  |false  |false      |

> üí¨: The truth table above is missing one result.  What is the result of ``P && Q`` when ``P = false`` and ``Q = true``?

#### OR (||) TRUTH TABLE

The following table shows the result for ``P || Q`` when ``P`` and ``Q`` are both expressions that can be ``true`` or ``false``.  As you can see below the result of ``P || Q`` is ``true`` if either ``P`` or ``Q`` is ``true``.  It is also ``true`` when both of them are ``true``.

| P     | Q     | P `\|\|` Q  |
|-------|-------|-----------|
|true   |true   |true       |
|true   |false  |true       |
|false  |true   |???        |
|false  |false  |false      |

> üí¨: The truth table above is missing one result.  What is the result of ``P || Q`` when ``P = false`` and ``Q = true``?

### Short Circuit Evaluation

![image](https://lirp.cdn-website.com/d7a1ea03/dms3rep/multi/opt/What-is-a-short-circuit--ACDC-Electric-llc-640w.jpg)

Both ``&&`` and ``||`` use **short circuit evaluation**.  That means that the second expression (on the right of the operator) isn't necessarily checked, if the result from the first expression is enough to tell if the compound boolean expression is true or false:

- If two boolean values/expressions are combined with a logical **or** (``||``) and the first expression is ``true``, then the second expression won‚Äôt be executed, since only one needs to be ``true`` for the result to be ``true``.
- If two boolean values/expressions are combined with a logical **and** (``&&``) and the first expression is ``false``, then the second expression won't be executed.  If the first expression is ``false``, the result will be ``false``, since both sides of the ``&&`` need to be ``true`` for the result to be ``true``.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

1. What is printed when the following code executes and x has been set to 0 and y to 3?
```java
if (x > 0 && (y / x) == 3) {
  System.out.println("first case");
}
else {
  System.out.println("second case");
}
```
2. What is printed when the following code executes and x has been set to zero and y is set to 3?
```java
if (x == 0 || (y / x) == 3) {
  System.out.println("first case");
}
else {
  System.out.println("second case");
}
```

#### Venn Diagram Activity
{:.no_toc}

üìù Explore the following problems in a group of 4:

1. Draw or print a [Venn diagram](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lpjk0LS_KdAddRurMayJZmaFzeyEg4FyhviZcSTXvtU/edit?usp=sharing) of 4 intersecting circles. Put the names of the 4 people in your group one in each circle. Write down the age of each person in your group in the circles. If two or more people are the same age, put the age in the intersecting parts of their circles. Write a Boolean expression that compares the age of each person in the group using ``==``, ``<``, ``>``, and ``&&``, for example Ada's age ``>`` Alan's age ``&&`` Alan's age ``==`` Grace's age. Then, ask each person in your group their favorite movie. If two or more people have the same favorite movie, put the movie in the intersecting parts of their circles. Write a Boolean expression that compares the favorite movies in the group using ``==``, ``!=``, and ``&&``, for example Ada's movie ``==`` Alan's movie ``&&`` Alan's movie ``!=`` Grace's movie. Think of 1 more comparison and write it in the circles and as a Boolean expression. Share the Boolean expressions with the class.
   
3. Write the sentence "If it's sunny, OR if the temperature is greater than 80 and it's not raining, I will go to the beach." as a Java if statement using an int variable ``temperature`` and boolean variables ``sunny`` and ``raining``.  If the conditional is true, print out "Go to the beach!". So, you will go to the beach on days that it is sunny in any temperature, or you will go to the beach on days when the temperature is over 80 degrees and it's not raining.

4. Complete a **truth table** for the if statement that you wrote in #2 with columns for sunny, temperature > 80, raining, and go to the beach.


   
#### Boolean Game
{:.no_toc}

<div class="task" markdown="block">

üé≤ Try the game below written to practice Booleans. Click on **Booleans**, look at the color and number in the block and evaluate the boolean expression to choose `true` or `false`. Then, check on Compound for an added challenge. See how high a score you can get!

<a href="https://csa-games.netlify.app/" target="_blank"><button class="btn">Boolean Game</button></a>

</div>

<!--

## And (`&&`), Or (`||`), and Not (`!`)

What if you want two things to be true before the body of the conditional is executed? Use `&&` (logical **and**) to join two Boolean expressions. The body will only execute if **both** are true.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

**Coding Exercise: Logical AND**

Test different combinations of `cleanedRoom` and `didHomework` to see when `"You can go out"` is printed.

```java
boolean cleanedRoom = true;
boolean didHomework = false;

if (cleanedRoom && didHomework) {
    System.out.println("You can go out");
} else {
    System.out.println("No, you can't go out");
}
````

</div>

---

Use `||` (logical **or**) when you want the body to execute if **at least one** condition is true.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

**Coding Exercise: Logical OR**

Test different combinations of `hasMoney` and `hasRide` to see when `"You can go to the mall"` is printed.

```java
boolean hasMoney = true;
boolean hasRide = false;

if (hasMoney || hasRide) {
    System.out.println("You can go to the mall");
} else {
    System.out.println("You can't go to the mall");
}
```

</div>

---

## Truth Tables

Logical expressions can be summarized in **truth tables** showing every possible combination of inputs and the resulting output.

Example for `&&` (**and**):

| A     | B     | A && B |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| true  | true  | true   |
| true  | false | false  |
| false | true  | false  |
| false | false | false  |

Example for `||` (**or**):

| A     | B     | A \|\| B |
| ----- | ----- | -------- |
| true  | true  | true     |
| true  | false | true     |
| false | true  | true     |
| false | false | false    |

---

## Using `!` (Logical NOT)

`!` negates a boolean expression ‚Äî it makes `true` become `false` and `false` become `true`.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

**Coding Exercise: Logical NOT**

Run the code and change `isRaining` to see how negation changes the output.

```java
boolean isRaining = true;

if (!isRaining) {
    System.out.println("Let's go outside!");
} else {
    System.out.println("Better stay inside!");
}
```

</div>

---

## Combining AND, OR, and NOT

Compound expressions can be combined in one condition. Use parentheses to control order of evaluation.

<div class="task" markdown="block">

**Coding Exercise: Complex Condition**

Test different values of `hasTicket`, `onGuestList`, and `over18` to see when entry is allowed.

```java
boolean hasTicket = true;
boolean onGuestList = false;
boolean over18 = true;

if ((hasTicket || onGuestList) && over18) {
    System.out.println("You can enter the event");
} else {
    System.out.println("Sorry, no entry");
}
```

</div>

---

## Summary

* `&&` is true only if **both** operands are true.
* `||` is true if **at least one** operand is true.
* `!` reverses a boolean value.
* Use parentheses for clarity and to control precedence.

## AP Practice

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 1</strong></summary>

What does this print if `a = true` and `b = false`?

```java
if (a && b) {
    System.out.println("yes");
} else {
    System.out.println("no");
}
```

**Answer:** `no` ‚Äî because `a && b` is `true && false`, which is `false`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Question 2</strong></summary>

What does this print if `a = true` and `b = false`?

```java
if (a || b) {
    System.out.println("yes");
} else {
    System.out.println("no");
}
```

**Answer:** `yes` ‚Äî because `a || b` is `true || false`, which is `true`.

</details>
