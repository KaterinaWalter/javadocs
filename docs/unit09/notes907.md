## Object Superclass

The ``Object`` class is the **superclass** of ALL other classes in Java and a part
of the built-in ``java.lang`` package. 

If a parent class isn‚Äôt specified using the ``extends`` keyword, the class will inherit from the ``Object`` class. What
does a class inherit from the ``Object`` class? 

The [AP CSA Reference Sheet](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/ap/pdf/ap-computer-science-a-java-quick-reference_0.pdf) lists the two main methods that are most frequently used:

- ``String toString()``
- ``boolean equals(Object other)``
