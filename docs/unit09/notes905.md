## Inheritance Hierarchies

If you have multiple subclasses that inherit from a superclass, you can form an **inheritance hierarchy**. Every subclass is-a or is a kind of the superclass. For example, here is an inheritance hierarchy of Shapes. Square is-a Rectangle and a subclass of Rectangle. Rectangle is-a Shape and a subclass of Shape. In Java, the class **Object** is at the top of hierarchy. Every class in Java inherits from Object and is-an Object.

One of the main reasons to use an inheritance hierarchy is that all the classes
in the hierarchy can be treated as instances of the top type in the hierarchy.
This is called **polymorphism** and we'll discuss it in more detail in the next
section.

Inheritance can also reduce code duplication since common behaviors can be
defined in methods in a superclass and inherited by all their subclasses. But
you should never use inheritance just to reuse code if there isn't a true ‚Äúis-a‚Äù
relationship between the subclass and the superclass.

üí¨ **DISCUSS:** 
* What **variables** and **methods** might be inherited from the superclass `Shape` in the inheritance hierarchy above?
* Can you make a 3-level inheritance hierarchy for **living things** on Earth?

### Superclass References

A superclass reference variable can hold an object of that superclass or of any of its subclasses. For example, a Shape reference variable can hold a Rectangle or Square object. (This is a type of **polymorphism** which will be defined in the next lesson).

```java
// The variables declared of type Shape can hold objects of its subclasses
Shape s1 = new Shape();
Shape s2 = new Rectangle();
Shape s3 = new Square();
```

Notice that the opposite is not true. You cannot declare a variable of the
subclass and put in a superclass object. For example, a Square reference cannot
hold a Shape object because not all Shapes are Squares. The code below will give
an "Incompatible types: Shape cannot be converted to Square" error.

```java
// A subclass variable cannot hold the superclass object!
// A Square is-a Shape, but not all Shapes are Squares.
Square q = new Shape(); // ERROR!!
```

Why is using a superclass reference for subclass objects useful? Because now, we can write methods with parameters of type Shape or have arrays of type Shape and use them with any of its subclasses as seen in the next sections.

### Superclass Method Parameters

Another advantage of an inheritance hierarchy is that we can write methods with parameters of the superclass type and pass in subclass objects to them. For example, the print(Shape) method below could be called with many different Shape subclasses and work for Rectangles, Squares, etc.

```java

    // This will work with all Shape subclasses (Squares, Rectangles, etc.) too
    public void print(Shape s)
    {
       ...
    }
```

Notice that in the following code, the print method has a parameter of type ``Person``, but it can be called with ``Student`` or ``Person`` objects in the ``main`` method. Which ``toString`` method is called? It depends on whether a ``Person`` or ``Student`` is passed in at runtime. What would happen if you commented out the ``toString`` method in ``Student``? Which one would be called now?

```java
public class Tester
  {
      // This will implicitly call the toString() method of object p
      public void print(Person p)
      {
          System.out.println(p);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
          Person p = new Person("Sila");
          Student s = new Student("Tully", 1001);
          Tester t = new Tester();
          t.print(p); // call print with a Person
          t.print(s); // call print with a Student
      }
  }

  class Person
  {
      private String name;

      public Person(String name)
      {
          this.name = name;
      }

      public String toString()
      {
          return name;
      }
  }

  class Student extends Person
  {
      private int id;

      public Student(String name, int id)
      {
          super(name);
          this.id = id;
      }

      public String toString()
      {
          return super.toString() + " " + id;
      }
  }
```
> Which toString() method is called below? What would happen if you commented out the Student toString() method? Which one would be called now?

### Superclass Arrays and ArrayLists

Using inheritance hierarchies, we can create arrays and ``ArrayLists`` using the
superclass type and put in values that are of the subclass types. This can be
very useful! For example, here is some code that creates a ``Shape[]`` array and
an ``ArrayList<Shape>``, both of which can hold any objects of ``Shape`` and any
of its subclasses.

```java
    // This shape array can hold the subclass objects too
    Shape[] shapeArray = { new Rectangle(), new Square(), new Shape() };

    // The shape ArrayList can add subclass objects too
    ArrayList<Shape> shapeList = new ArrayList<Shape>();
    shapeList.add(new Shape());
    shapeList.add(new Rectangle());
    shapeList.add(new Square());
```

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Summary

- An **inheritance hierarchy** of subclasses inheriting from superclasses can be formed with Object being the top of the hierarchy.

- When a class S "is-a" class T, T is referred to as a **superclass**, and S is referred to as a **subclass**.

- If S is a subclass of T, then a reference of type T can be used to refer to an object of type T or S. This is called **polymorphism**, defined more in the next lesson.

- Declaring references of type T, when S is a subclass of T, is useful in the declaring formal method parameters of type T, arrays of type T[], and ArrayList<T> of type T so that all the subclasses of T can also be used with these.
