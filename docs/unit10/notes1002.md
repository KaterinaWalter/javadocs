## What is Recursion?

**Recursion** is when a _method calls itself_. 

{:.highlight} The AP CSA exam usually has about **4-6 recursion problems** in the MCQ section. You only need to know how to _trace recursive methods_, as in, figure out what they _return_ or _print_.
> You will NOT be asked to _write_ a recursive method on the exam.
